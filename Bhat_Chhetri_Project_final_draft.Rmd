# Introduction

 **Wine** has been historically consumed by humans as one of the important alcoholic beverages highly popular throughout the world. About 7.9 billion of the world's population drink wine as an alcoholic beverage. In the USA, about 118 million people drink wine, among them females 45% and males 15%.   While many tout its health benefits, researchers and medical experts continue to debate whether the drink can offer a wholesome advantage to human health. ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizthach/2022/04/25/us-wine-market-sales-up-168-in-2021-pointing-towards-hot-wine-trends-in-2022/?sh=1146f53743d2)) 

## Background 

This study considers data from **Vinho Verde**, a unique wine production from the Northwest region of Portugal. A total of **6497** wines were collected from May 2004 to February 2007 using only protected designation of origin samples that were tested at the official certification entity **Comissao de Viticultura da Regiao dos Vinhos Verdes**(CVRVV) and recorded by a computerized system (iLab). The most common physiological test and the sensory test are conducted to separate data sets of white and red wine. A sensory test was done via blind test, which graded wine on a scale from zero(very bad) to 10(excellent)([link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377)). The result of this test is useful for improving the production process and improve the quality of the wine. 

## Description

In this dataset, the goal is to make prediction of wine quality based on some chemical facts. Despite the initial data, the wine is scored from (0-10) some of which may guess that data is much more suited to be predicted using regression, we need to remember that the score is discrete, which makes classification model more suitable for this analysis.

**The purpose **of this analysis is to construct the prediction of wine quality based on some chemical facts and interpretation of the model by deriving five most important factors for wine quality. Will it be percentage of alcohol, acidity or other variables?this analysis will try to answer these questions after analyzing this dataset.

The essential **owner** of this dataset were Paulo Cortez, University of Minho, Guimares, Portugal,
([link](https://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez)) A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis, Viticulture Commission of the Vinho Verde Region(CVRVV), Porto, Portugal and the data was **collected by** A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis, Viticulture Commission of the **Vinho Verde** Region(**CVRVV**), Porto, Portugal. The data representative was included all samples stored in CVRVV.

**The strength** of the dataset represents only one product of wine produced in **Minho** region of Portugal,first dataset of this kind, highly popular, with 2 million UCI download. The data set is large, but the proportion of red and white wine data is significantly different. The white wine representation is three times higher than the red wine data. The number of data set is a huge strength of this study as the probability of inclusion is higher. The separate data set for red and white wine gives clear demarcation on data characters. The inclusion of sensory tests along with physio-chemical tests gives more clarity on the result. One of the best things about this data set is they did not have null values in the observations section of all the variables, which helps in easy analysis of the data by preventing the statistical power, biased estimates and invalid inclusions. The dataset is publicly available, so everyone can use it to analyze in different programming languages.

**The weakness** was lack of other relevant features, such as selling price, production cost, etc. The relationship between human experts and the physio-chemical lab test data set is not clear yet. This data set does not represent any other brand of wine available in the market, other than this unique product from Portugal, and the data set contains only numeric variables without a categorical variable, which creates complications in ggplot.Similarly the variable names are in the column names without row names that creates the trouble in proper analysis and plot.Similarly the main missingness of this dataset is no row names and categorical variables.
When it comes to understanding whether wine can be useful to human health and to what extent it can be healthy for the human body, it is very important to understand the various chemical components that make up the wine. It is also important to understand the distinction between **white and red wine**, the two general wine types that are produced and marketed today, not only because they are produced and inventoried in different ways. Also, their chemical composition might not be the same. This can evidently offer whether one is better than the other.

**Figure: 2.1 Bar graph for chlorides in wine dataset**

This bar plot represents the distribution of chlorides based on its amount present in the wine. As we can observe less amount of chlorides is good for the wine. Most of the wine in the data has less amount of chloride categorized as low(<0.050g/L), maximum amount as high(>0.065g/L) and moderate amount categorized as medium(>0.051g/L).However, low amount of chlorides was reported in maximum wine samples.

**Figure: 2.2 The histogram of alcohol in wine style**

This histogram represents the distribution of red and white wine based on percentage of alcohol by volume. As seen from the plot most of the wine has alcohol amount less then 10%.The gghighlight fuction hilighted the maximum distribution based on amount of alcohol more than 10%.There is very less number of red wine identified at alcohol level (14%)compared to white wine.

**Figure: 2.3 Box plot of sulphates in wine style ** 

The box plot of sulphates across the wine type indicates that the amount of sulphates present in the wine dataset is not uniform or widely distributed. The median value of sulphates for the white wine is slightly above the first quartile where as the red wine is above the lower median quartile, this indicates there is significant difference of sulphates in wine type. In white wine median value lies slightly about the lower quartile(25%), where as the red wine lies lower half quartile(50%) which help to easily identify the sulphates amount in wine dataset.

```
**Figure: 2.4 Scatter plot for fixed and volatile acidity **

The scatter plot shows the relationship between the volatile and fixed acidity in both wines. Acidities are highly scattered in red wine where as white wine is more concentrated at level of 8gm/lit on volatile and 0.4 mg/lit on fixed site. Graph shows that red wine acidity (volatile and fixed) are significantly higher distribution compared to white wine.

**Figure: 2.5 Box plot for quality Vs alcohol and residual sugar of wine. The quality is based on the rating given by experts (A=>6.5,B=>4.9 & C=<4.8)**

The box graph 'A' and 'B' shows the minimum, maximum, first quartile, second quartile (median) and third quartile of the alcohol present in the wine dataset. As observed in quality rating 'C' the wine quality is evenly distributed and no high variation is observed. While in category 'B', amount of alcohol has wide variations. The amount of alcohol above the upper quartile is very high.
 Besides in 'A', the distribution is similar  as in 'C'. Clearly, the wine with quality 'B' has large amount of alcohol.The quality is determined  based on rating of the wine. The quality 'A' has rating>6.5, B>4.9 and C<4.8.

Similarly, the box graph figure 'B' shows the minimum, maximum, first quartile, second quartile(median) and third quartile of the residual sugar present in the wine dataset. As we observed in quality rating 'B' the wine quality is evenly distributed without any variations and upper quartile is high. While in category 'A' amount of residual sugar has wide variation, the amount of sugar observed below the median quartile. Besides in 'B' the distribution is similar in 'C'. The wine quality 'B' has large amount of residual sugar. The quality rating is same in graph figure 'A'.

**Figure: 3.2 Demographic table for categorical variables of wine dataset**

The descriptive statistic on demographic table of categorical variables of the wine dataset  shows the frequencies, percentage and fraction of the given variables. In chlorides categorical variable most of the red wine samples lies on higher category with(84.9%) that means amount of chlorides in those wine more than (0.065 gm/L), where as in white wine it is about(5.7%)on this category.Similarly low chloride category is higher(76.3%)in white wine with chlorides amount (between 0.051-0.065 gm/L) where as in red wine with(3.9%).In alcohol category, white wine with best category (16.6%) having alcohol amount more than (12%) by volume compared to red wine(10.1%). In quality category white wine shows higher 'A' with(21.6%)based on the rating more than 6.5 for each sample, where as in red wine with(13.6%). There is insignificance differences in 'B' and 'C' category in both wines.

# Conclusion 
 
 This data set was collected from kaggle.com ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dell4010/wine-dataset)), one of the publicly available site and this data set was collected by Paulo Cortez et.al,.This data set only contains 11 physio chemical and one sensory variables and all of them have numeric values.
