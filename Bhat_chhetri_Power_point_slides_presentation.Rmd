```
## Descriptive background
>- This study considers data from ***Vinho Verde***, a unique wine production from the Northwest region of Portugal(available in kaggle.com).
>- The data set was used to analyzed  for the quality of wine affected by Physio-chemical compounds.


>- The essential **owner** of this dataset is Prof.Dr. Paulo Cortez, University of Minho, Guimares, Portugal.


>- The physio-chemical variables are sulphates,chlorides, alcohol, pH etc and sensory variable is  quality.


## Main features of the dataset
>- The data were collected from May 2004 to February 2007 using only protected designation of origin samples that were tested at the official certification entity ***Comissao de Viticultura da Regiao dos Vinhos Verdes***(CVRVV) and recorded by a computerized system (iLab).

>- The data set has only the numeric variables with 1599 red wines and 4898 white wines.


>- The analysed variables result showed that White wines are of higher quality.

## Conclusion

>- The data analysis program was successfully used to create plots for direct comparison of various wine attributes

>- Analysis shows that the distribution of chlorides is higher in low category group which represents the better quality of wine.


>- The data shows that high quality of wine has a higher percentage of alcohol. 

>- Red wine was found to be higher sulphates than white wine.

>- The analysis concludes that the white wines are of higher quality than the red wines.
